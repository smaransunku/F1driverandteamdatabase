    backstory: "Lewis Hamilton is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula 1 drivers of all time. Growing up in Stevenage, England, Hamilton's journey to F1 began at a young age when he started karting at six. His father Anthony worked multiple jobs to fund his racing career. Hamilton caught the attention of McLaren team principal Ron Dennis at an awards ceremony when he was just 10 years old, telling Dennis 'I want to race for you one day.' He joined the McLaren young driver programme in 1998. Hamilton made his F1 debut with McLaren in 2007, nearly winning the championship in his rookie season. He secured his first title in 2008, becoming the youngest world champion at the time. After six seasons with McLaren, Hamilton moved to Mercedes in 2013, where he dominated the sport, winning six more championships and breaking numerous records. In 2025, Hamilton made a blockbuster move to Ferrari, fulfilling a lifelong dream to drive for the iconic Italian team. His first season at Ferrari in 2025 showed flashes of brilliance as he adapted to the Scuderia's culture and car philosophy. Now in his second Ferrari season in 2026, Hamilton continues to chase that elusive eighth world championship. Off track, Hamilton is a vocal advocate for diversity, environmental causes, and social justice.",

Born in Balcarce, Argentina, Fangio didn't start racing until his mid-twenties due to financial constraints and worked as a mechanic. He competed in dangerous South American road races throughout the 1940s before European teams noticed his talent. Fangio made his F1 debut in 1950 at age 38 and immediately showed his class. Despite his late start, he became the oldest F1 champion and held the record for most championships until Schumacher broke it in 2003. Fangio drove for multiple teams during his career - Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes, and Maserati - winning championships with four different constructors, a feat never repeated. His 1957 German GP victory at the Nürburgring is considered one of the greatest drives in F1 history. Known for his smooth, calculated driving style and ability to feel the limits of his car, Fangio competed in an era where racing was extremely dangerous. He retired in 1958 and remained a respected figure in motorsport until his death in 1995.",

    backstory: "Oscar Piastri burst onto the F1 scene as one of the most decorated junior drivers in recent history. Born in Melbourne, Piastri began karting at age nine and moved to Europe at 14 to pursue his racing dream. He won three consecutive championships from 2019-2021: Formula Renault Eurocup, FIA F3, and F2 - an unprecedented feat. Despite winning F2, Piastri spent 2022 as Alpine's reserve driver due to no available seat, leading to a contract dispute when both Alpine and McLaren claimed to have signed him. The Contract Recognition Board ruled in McLaren's favor, and Piastri made his debut in 2023. He quickly proved his worth with consistent points finishes and impressive racecraft. His breakthrough came in 2024 with his maiden win at the Hungarian GP and a second victory in Azerbaijan, establishing himself as a future star.

Promoted to F2 for 2023-2024, Hadjar was consistently competitive, winning multiple races and finishing as vice-champion in 2024. His aggressive racing style, strong qualifying pace, and ability to overtake drew comparisons to Max Verstappen. Red Bull promoted him to their RB team (formerly AlphaTauri) for 2025, partnering Yuki Tsunoda. His rookie season showed flashes of the speed that impressed Red Bull, though he also experienced typical rookie mistakes. Known for his fearless wheel-to-wheel racing and late-braking maneuvers, Hadjar brings excitement and raw speed. If he performs well in 2026, he could be in line for a future Red Bull Racing seat. The pressure is on to deliver consistent results and prove he deserves to stay on the F1 grid.",

    backstory: "Gabriel Bortoleto is Brazil's newest F1 hope, carrying the nation's dreams of finding the next Ayrton Senna. Born in São Paulo, Bortoleto began karting at age seven and showed immediate promise. He dominated Brazilian karting before moving to Europe to compete in international championships. Bortoleto won multiple karting titles before transitioning to cars. He impressed in Formula 4, winning the 2022 Spanish F4 championship. Moving to FIA F3 for 2023, Bortoleto finished third in his rookie season with multiple wins. McLaren signed him to their driver development program, recognizing his talent. In his first F2 season in 2024, Bortoleto stunned everyone by winning the championship, becoming the first rookie to win F2 since Charles Leclerc in 2017. His combination of raw speed, racecraft, and consistency impressed the entire paddock. Sauber (transitioning to become Audi in 2026) signed him for 2025, believing he's a future star worth investing in. His rookie F1 season was challenging at the struggling Sauber team, but he showed maturity and extracted maximum performance from the difficult car. Known for his aggressive overtaking, strong tire management, and ability to perform under pressure, Bortoleto has impressed observers despite limited results. Partnering Nico Hülkenberg, he's learned from an experienced teammate while showcasing his own talents. Brazil is watching closely, hoping he can restore their F1 glory as Audi's full works team arrives in 2026.",
